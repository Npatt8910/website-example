        <h3>About</h3>
  Ferrari is an Italian car company that makes fast cars. They are made in Italy
  and are very expensive. They usually cost $150,000 - $1,500,000.Ferraris first
  car was the Ferrari 125 SFerrari 125 S replicaFerrari has a rich racing history and
   is a well known premium car brand.
The fastest street Ferrari is the F50 GT1, which can go over 370 kph (about 222 mph).
 The most powerful Ferrari is the FXX, which has about 800 horsepower.
The FXX is a lighter, improved version of the F60 Enzo; it is Ferrari's most
 exclusive model, which you have to be chosen to own. It is basically a race
  car that you can buy from Ferrari. The car is so extreme (completely flat tires,
 low ride height, and no roadcar safety features such as Airbags) that it cannot be
 driven on roads legally. Ferrari will keep it for you at their Factory in Maranello
in Italy. You can go to Italy and drive it on their private race track, or have it
transported to another race track around the world, the same as if you were driving
 for a racing team. Thirty have been built and all but two were sold to customers
for $2,500,000 each. Ferrari gave one to seven-time Formula 1 World Champion Michael
Schumacer, who had driven for Ferrari for ten years when he retired in 2006, having
brought Ferrari much success. Ferrari made his FXX different by painting it black.
The other twenty-nine are either red or white, with stripes painted in the other
          colour.
